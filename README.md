# Congestion Cargo Yards

**Congestion on Cargo Yards**

## PROJECT PLANNING STAGE

### Introduction

A **Supply Chain Manager** takes control of the yard for delivering cargos at the Interchange. The person does this for managing the cargo congestion. Cargo congestion is in turn the responsibility of the **Yard Manager** who ensures effective measures are in place for facilities management. 

A Cargo undergoes lifecycle stages from: Picking up from Ships and loading into the Yard, then drop-off the cargo containers at the Interchange and finally delivering the cargo via a routed shipment mode.

### Annotation of Video using Vehicles In Traffic

**How you describe your Traffic Congestion within the yard has been explained here. With this video one can achieve annotation to a greater degree of accuracy with very less model complexity.**
